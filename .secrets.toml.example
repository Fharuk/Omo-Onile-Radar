# Streamlit Secrets Configuration Example
# 
# To use email notifications:
# 1. Copy this file to .streamlit/secrets.toml in your project root
# 2. Fill in your email credentials below
# 3. For Gmail, you MUST use an App Password (not your regular password)
#    - Go to: https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
#    - Generate an app password for "Mail"
#    - Use that password below
# 4. Never commit secrets.toml to version control!

[email]
admin_email = "your-email@gmail.com"
admin_password = "your-app-password-here"

# Optional: Configure a different SMTP server
# smtp_server = "smtp.gmail.com"  # Default
# smtp_port = 587  # Default
